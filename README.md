## Fraudulent Jobs Posting Prediction


## Problem
A fake job posting is a (rarely) smartly designed type of scam aimed at job seekers for a variety of unprofessional reasons. Still, these scams can look legit to an unsuspicious person scrolling through the vast pool of jobs. And although most tech talents arenâ€™t actively looking for a new employer, falling for a phantom ad is still realistic. How so?

Scammers will sometimes go the extra mile to draw the attention of their target audience, more often than not, by offering incredibly high salary ranges or another sort of advantage that seems too good to be true.


## Inspiration

2) Identify key traits/features (words, entities, phrases) of job descriptions which are fraudulent in nature.

4) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to identify interesting insights from this dataset.
